On a warm, sunny afternoon, there was a boy named Rayhan and he was playing against another boy named Abdullah in a Yu-Gi-Oh dual. "Mwa-ha-ha!" says Rayhan as he attacks Abdullah's "Elemental Hero Sparkman" with his "Blue Eyes White Dragon." With a smile, Abdullah activates his "Sakuretsu Armor" Trap Card. Rayhan chains with the Counter trap card "Dark Bribe" but then Abdullah chains with his own Counter trap card "Seven Tools of the Bandit", by paying the cost of 1,000 Life Points.
